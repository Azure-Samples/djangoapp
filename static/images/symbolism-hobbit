      <p><img src="symbolism-hobbit_files/symbolism-hobbit.jpg" alt="Symbolism in The Hobbit" align="right" height="188" width="121">As
 both an  author and a literary scholar, J.R.R. Tolkien makes his 
dislike of allegory and  symbolism well known. In the preface to <em>the Lord of the Rings Trilogy</em>,
 Tolkien wrote, "As  for any inner meaning or 'message', it has in the 
intention of the author none.  It is neither allegorical nor topical. <em>The  Hobbit</em> is  the prequel to the <em>Lord of the Rings Trilogy</em>.
 Tolkien never  differentiated between the two works to suggest that one
 might contain  symbolism while the other did not.  For this reason, 
many fans of<em> The Hobbit </em>may contend that the book  contains no symbolism.</p>
      <p> However, those looking  for symbols will certainly find them. 
The hobbits, with their love of good food  and a quiet, conventional 
life, may serve as a symbol for common people. The  named weapons, such 
as Gandalf's Glamdring, are symbols for the weapons used by  heroic 
soldiers. Smaug the dragon may be a symbol for intelligent evil.</p>
      <p> These symbols are  pivotal to the novel's central development 
of Bilbo's character. Bilbo begins  the story as a common person, a 
simple hobbit. He gradually transforms into a  hero due to his 
adventures that require him to challenge and defeat mighty  enemies, 
including the trolls and Smaug. When Bilbo names his sword  "Sting," he 
completes his evolution from a common person to become a  true hero.</p>
